# wild-creativity
Holds inspiration and possibly dreams
in all things deep and true
where feelings flow like wandering streams
I stand here waiting, thinking of you
then all at once a rush of heat
my balance takes a fault, I sway,
the trees as well move in a dance
bright fall leaves want to play
a gentle wind moves by my face
the memory of you begins to fade
I find myself back inside at work
I take a deep breath, and wish I'd stayed
outside a bit longer in the autumn air
that's ok, I'll go out again soon.
